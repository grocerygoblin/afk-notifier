##This is a very simple (and bad) script I wrote to update a sheet with my AFK status.

I use Moonlight on my PC to share my hardware with my household whenever they want to use it, and we had no way of efficiently checking whether someone is using the computer without directly asking them or invading their privacy/terminating their connection.

Now we do. They simply open a shared Google Sheet and it will inform them whether the PC is active along with the last relevant timestamp.
(I can watch porn in total privacy!)

Working on some enhancements/features as of this writing (10/20/2024).
